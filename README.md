# Pwnbooks-BinaryExploitation üìô

## What is This?‚ùì
A large archive of writeups for the CTF competition's Binary Exploitation category with the purpose of educating other CTF competitors about hacking techniques.

## Who Writes These? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
All of these writeups are written by me :D (Shuban Pal)

CTF is one of my favorite passtime activities. So everytime I get to solve a CTF problem, a part of the joy I gain is sharing my thought process to others.

CTFs I have played in:
```
PicoCTF 2022 (First CTF)
HSCTF 9
Imaginary CTF 2022
PicoCTF 2023
HSCTF 10
Imaginary CTF 2023
PicoCTF 2024
UTCTF 2024
```

However, I may also include writeups from old or other CTFs I have not competed in



### My Pico Experience

I am not a competitive player, I play CTF rather casually with friends as a sort of computer science puzzle. I mainly do `Binary Exploitation` (also called `Pwn`) in CTF competitions and have experience in using tools such as:

- üêçPython
- ü•∑Pwntools
- ü¶ó GNU Debugger (GDB)
- üêßLinux
- üêâGhidra

I am not a security professional, I am just a high schooler learning and improving my Pwn and Binary Exploitation skills. As I improve, I will make sure to go back and improve the quality of any of the content stored here and I will also expand this collection to fit more complex problems.
