# PicoPwnbooks-BinaryExploitation

## What is This?‚ùì
A large archive of writeups for the PicoCTF competition's Binary Exploitation category with the purpose of educating other CTF competitors about hacking techniques

## Who Trites These? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
All of these writeups are written by me :D (Shuban Pal)

CTF is one of my favorite passtime activities. So everytime I get to solve a CTF problem, a part of the joy I gain is sharing my thought process to others.

### My Pico Experience

I am not a competitive player, I play CTF rather casually with friends as a sort of computer science puzzle. I mainly do `Binary Exploitation` and `Pwn` in CTF competitions and have experience in using tools such as:

- üêçPython
- ü•∑Pwntools
- ü¶ó GNU Debugger (GDB)
- üêßLinux
- üêâGhidra
